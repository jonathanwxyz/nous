- We focus on the infinite set of large values of n, ignoring small values of n
- We measure:
	- Run time
	- Memory/storage requirements
	- Bandwidth/power requirements
- We make the assumptions when analysing algorithms that:
	- All memory is equally expensive to access
	- No concurrent operations
	- All reasonable instructions take unit time except function calls
	- Constant word size unless manipulating bits
- Time and space complexity generally a function of input size
- Input Size:
	- Sorting: number of input items
	- Multiplication: total number of bits
	- Graph algorithm: total number of nodes and edges
	- etc
- We can analyse worst case and average case
	- Worst case is an absolute guarantee and is an upper bound
	- Average case provides expected run time but hard to measure
		- could measure random inputs or real life inputs
