## Divide-and-conquer involves three steps at each level of recursion
- __Divide__ the problem into smaller instances of the same problem (D(n))
- __Conquer__ the subproblems recursively. If the problems are small enough then we solve them directly (aT(n/b))
- __Combine__ the solutions into a solution for the original problem (C(n))
