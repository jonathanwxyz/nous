#Distributed-Systems 

- The way nodes are linked may vary
- Composed of varied (heterogeneous) resources (software and hardware), deployed by different people and organisations
- In essence there is a network of networks, each managed with local scope by different administrators
- As a consequence, no (complex/useful) network of networks is reliable
