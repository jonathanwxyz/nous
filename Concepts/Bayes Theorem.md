### Formula
> # $P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H).P(H)}{P(E)}$
> ## $P(E) = P(E|H).P(H) + P(E|\neg H).P(\neg H)$

### Rationale
New evidence does not completely determine our beliefs in a vacuum. It should update prior beliefs!

### Terminology
- Hypothesis $H$
- Evidence $E$
- Prior - $P(H)$
- Likelihood - $P(E|H)$
- Posterior - $P(H|E)$

### Area

It can be useful to think about the various probabilities in terms of areas
- The left column being the cases where our hypothesis is true
	- Right being were the hypothesis is false
- Then in each column we have a probability of the evidence given the hypothesis is true/false.
