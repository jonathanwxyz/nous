A way of being able to do [[Geometrical Transformations]] through only [[Matrix]] multiplication

- In order to use a consistent matrix representation for all kinds of linear transformations, weâ€™ve had to add an extra coordinate, w, to our usual 3D coordinate (x,y,z)
- Usually w = 1, if it isn't we normalise the matrix so that it is (divide throughout by w)

### Composite Transformations

If we now apply a transformation to P' we have:

This is equivalent to multiplying the transformations you want to apply then multiply this composite transformation with the original vector

This is ==Non-Commutative==, the order in which you apply transformations does matter

Example:
2d scaling by (sx, sy)
we first want to apply a translation to bring the object to the origin M1
then apply the scaling M2
then apply the opposite translation M3
we can do this all in one transformation by computing Mc = M3 . M2. M1

### Inversions

Matrix A and B are [[Matrix Inverses|inverses]] of each other

### Non-Invertible Transformations

The transformation here cannot be undone
