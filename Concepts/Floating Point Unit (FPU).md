Dedicated hardware for calculating [[Floating Point Arithmetic]].

### Advantages
- We need [[Floating Point Numbers]] to represent very large and small numbers in an economical way
- An FPU [[Co-processors|co-processor]] offloads work from the main processor and massively speeds up computation

### Disadvantages
- FPUs can be large
- FP operations are rare in most applications therefore not speed critical
- Including them comes at a cost
- All calculations can be done in software on the main CPU although it's slower
