- ==Hypothesis==: Prediction made by a trained machine learning model.  
- [[Sample Error]]
- [[True Error]]

- What we wish to know is the true error, however this is seldom possible.
- We CAN always compute the sample error (simply the error in our sample)
- Infinite samples: sample error converges to true error
- Insufficient samples: Sample error may not approximate true error well.
