### What is it?
- **Definition**: Reinforcement learning is an area of [[Machine Learning]] concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to ==maximize the notion of cumulative reward==.
- There is a “teacher” who provides feedback on the action of an agent, in terms of ==reward== and ==punishment==
- Example: Helicopter manoeuvre; example reward can be following a desired trajectory; and an example punishment can be crashing.
