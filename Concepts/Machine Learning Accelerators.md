Machine learning tasks are very specific and thus require its own hardware
![[Pasted image 20221227171220.png]]
- ML is very compute intesive (worse than graphics)
- Essentially matrix operations (dot products)
- Dedicated accelerators:
	- only use essential things but maximise compute

Example: [[Google TPU]]
