### What are Diffuse and Specular Reflection?

#### Specular
- An object with perfect specular reflection is a perfect mirror, the light comes back as it went in (this is an approximation which is not really met in the real world).

- A imperfect specular surface reflects an incoming ray across a small range of angles
- The surface looks shiny, with highlights

#### Diffuse
Diffuse reflection is only reflecting back certain wavelengths of light, for example the greenness of a leaf comes from only green light waves being reflected back through its ==absorption== of light and ==uniform re-radiation==.
- Some wavelengths are absorbed, others are reflected
- A perfect diffuse surface reflects an incoming ray across all angles

- The surface looks dull or matte

#### Diffuse and Specular
Most surfaces exhibit a ==mixture== of diffuse and specular reflection.
