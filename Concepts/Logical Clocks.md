#Distributed-Systems 

Logical clocks take advantage of the fact that an implicit partial ordering of events can be obtained from the simple sending and receiving of messages between processes in a distributed system. As such, they do not measure “real time” but, instead, provide a distributed incremental pseudo time to events in a distributed system
