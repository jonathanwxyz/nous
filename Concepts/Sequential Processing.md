#Distributed-Systems 

### What is it?
A ==simple== form of processing where we simply execute instructions one at a time in sequence, this can be quite ==limiting==

### Limitations
- A process may have to wait on user input, in a sequential system everything would halt
- A process may have multiple computationally demanding functions that could perhaps be run ==concurrently  in different processes==
	- Or even better in ==parallel in different processors==
