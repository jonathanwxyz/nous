### What is it?
A confusion matrix is a way of measuring actual facts against the predicted facts of a model. Has applications in [[Machine Learning]], AI and Stats.

### Error Matrix
Each row represents samples in a predicted class, while each column represents samples in an actual class (or vice versa).

### 2x2 Matrix
Another way (compared to the Error Matrix) is to just focus on a particular class at a time (for example, cat) and measure when the model correctly predicted it and when it didn't.

This matrix reports the ==True Positives==, ==False Positives==, ==False Negatives==, and ==True Negatives==.
