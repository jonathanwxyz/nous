Here we have computed the [[sample error|sample classification error]], using a set of n  
samples.

The confidence interval tells us
> With p probability, the true error lies in the interval of

- We wish to to have a small ==a== for a more precise estimate, and a large ==p== for higher confidence.

### Comments
- This confidence interval is an approximate.  
- It works pretty well for over 30 samples and with sample error not too close to 0 or 1.
