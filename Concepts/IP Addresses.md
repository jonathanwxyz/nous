### What is it?
- An Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) serves two purposes: it is a ‘unique’ identifier and also contains some information about ‘where’ a device is on a network.
- The top-level authority for IP addresses is the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
	- which delegates ranges of the address space to five Regional Internet Registries, which in turn delegate sub ranges of their space to Internet service providers.
		 - This is an example of [[Delegating Naming Responsibilities]]
	 - Note that, unlike [[MAC addresses]], the delegation of IP addresses takes place initially to geographical regions (rather than ‘hardware vendors’)
- IP addresses can tell you some information about the location of a device on a network.

### IPv4
- 32 bit addresses
- usually written as 4 8 bit numbers seperated by dots (e.g. 130.88.192.9)
- Not enough addresses for every person on the planet to have a device (see IPv6)

### IPv6W
- Uses 128 bit addresses which allows for many many more IP addresses than there are people on the planet
