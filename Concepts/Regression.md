#Machine-Learning 

A form of [[Supervised Learning]] that gives a continuous output.
- Goal: Estimate the relationships among the input and output variables.  
- Training data: Observed input variables and their corresponding ==continuous output variables==.

### Performance Measures

To work out ==Regression Error== we need to work out the difference between the predicted output and real (/observed/ground) truth.
- Core idea: Assess error for each of the n samples and for each of the m output values, and average the errors.
- Commonly used regression performance metric:
	- [[Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)]]
	- [[Mean Absolute Error (MAE)]]
	- [[Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)]]
	- [[Coefficient of determination or R-squared]]
