#Distributed-Systems 

### What are they?
- In [[Distributed System]]s, names are used to ==uniquely identify== entities
- Importantly, a name must be resolvable to an entity; this process of a process accessing a named entity is called ==name resolution==
	- This is supported by a ==naming system==

### Approaches
- [[Centralised Naming]]
- [[Free-for-All Naming]]
- [[Delegating Naming Responsibilities]]
	- This approach is taken by the internet; the largest [[Distributed System]]

### Examples of Naming Schemes
- [[MAC Addresses]]
- [[IP Addresses]]
- [[Domain Names]]
