### What is it?
A step in [[Compilers|compilation]] in the [[Compiler Back-End]] phase.

- The goal is to improve the intermediate code and, thus, the effectiveness of code generation and the performance of the target code.
- Optimisations can range from trivial (e.g. constant folding) to highly sophisticated (e.g, in-lining).
- Modern compilers perform such a range of optimisations, that one could argue for:

Rather than the traditional front-end back-end dichotomy.
