#Distributed-Systems 

### What is it?
- An approach to [[Naming Schemes]] where the authority to allocate names is ==delegated to smaller parts of the system==, and governed by some rules
- A better balance compared to [[Free-for-All Naming]] and [[Centralised Naming]]
	- However now there must be consideration put into how to split up the naming
		- e.g by organisation or by area, etc.

### Examples of Delegated Naming Schemes
- [[MAC Addresses]]
- [[IP Addresses]]
- [[Domain Names]]
