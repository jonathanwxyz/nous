- A measure of computer performance
	- Useful in fields of scientific computations that require [[Floating Point Arithmetic|floating point calculations]]
	- Also for very large and very small numbers (large dynamic range computations)
		- [[Floating Point Numbers|Floating-point representation]]: similar to scientific notation, except in base 2
- For the cases above FLOPS are a better measurement than [[Instructions Per Second]]
- Terraflops: one million million $10^{12}$ FLOPS 
	- In computers today with Exaflops down the pike!
