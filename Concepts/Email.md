#Distributed-Systems 

### How does it work?
- Electronic mail (email) seems like a simpler system than ‘the Web’, in many ways it is more complex. 
- The expectation is that an email has to be in exactly one place at any one time.  
	- If it is in two places at the same time then it has been duplicated accidentally.  
	- If it is in zero places then it has been lost ‘in the system’, in detriment of the sender and the recipient of that email.
