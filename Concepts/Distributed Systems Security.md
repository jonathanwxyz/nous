#Distributed-Systems 

Security in [[Distributed System]]s can be split roughly into 2 parts:
1. Communication between users or processes, possibly residing on different machines.
	- solution: secure channels
1. Authorization, to ensure that a process gets only those access rights to the resources in a distributed system it is entitled to.
	- solution: access control

### Types of Security Threats
- ==Interception==: an unauthorized party has gained access to a service or data. Example: When communication between two parties has been overheard by someone else
- ==Interruption==: services or data become unavailable, unusable, destroyed, and so on. Examples: denial of service attacks by which someone maliciously attempts to make a service inaccessible to other parties; when a file is corrupted or lost, etc.
- ==Modification==: unauthorized changing of data or tampering with a service Examples: intercepting and subsequently changing transmitted data, tampering with database entries, etc.
- ==Fabrication==: additional data or activity are generated that would normally not exist. Examples: an intruder may attempt to add an entry into a password file or database; breaking into a system by replaying previously sent messages.

### Security Mechanisms
#### Encryption
- Prevents confidentiality and integrity checks
- Two types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
	- In symmetric encryption the same secret value (the key) is used for encryption and decryption whereas different keys are used in asymmetric encryption.

#### Authentication
- Used to verify the claimed identity of a user, client, server, host, or other entity
- Authentication is based on the possession of some secret information, like password, known only to the entities participating in the authentication
- When an entity wants to authenticate another entity, the former will verify if the latter possesses the knowledge of the secret.
- Authentication can be one-way or mutual.
	- In one-way authentication, only one entity verifies the identity of the other entity.
	- In mutual authentication, both communicating entities verify each other’s identity.

#### Authorisation
- Authorization checks whether a client is authorized to perform the action requested.

#### Auditing
- Auditing tools are used to trace which clients accessed what, and in which way.
- Audit logs can be extremely useful for the analysis of a security breach, and subsequently taking measures against intruders.

### Cryptography

Here plaintext means unencrypted, ciphertext means encrypted text.
Cryptography here protects us of the 3 attacks shown above.

### Secure Channels
"The issue of protecting communication between clients and servers, can be thought of in terms of setting up a secure channel between communicating parties."
- A secure channel protects senders and receivers against interception, modification, and fabrication of messages.
- Protecting messages against interception is done by ensuring confidentiality: the secure channel ensures that its messages cannot be eavesdropped by intruders.
- Protecting against modification and fabrication by intruders is done through protocols for mutual authentication and message integrity.

#### Example based on Shared Secret Key
![[Pasted image 20230415195411.png]]
1. Alice sends an initial (challenge) message to Bob indicating she'd like to start a secure channel
2. Bob reponds with a challenge
3. Alice sends an encrypted message of what was given in 2.
	- Bob can decrypt this to find the same message that he'd sent in 2. Bob knows that Alice is who she claims she is as she has the shared key
4. Alice sends a challenge to Bob
5. Bob encrypts Alice's challenge with the shared key
	- Alice decrypts this, if the message is the same as 4 then she knows Bob is who he claims to be

#### Digital Signature
This can help maintain message integrity

#### Example Situation
- Consider the situation in which Bob has just sold Alice a collector’s item of some vinyl record for $500. The whole deal was done through e-mail.
- Besides authentication, at least two concerns that need to be addressed: 
	1) Alice needs to be assured that Bob will not maliciously change the $500 and claim she promised more than $500. 
	2) Bob needs to be assured that Alice cannot deny ever having sent the message.
- Possible solution: Alice digitally signs the message, uniquely binding her signature to its content.
- The unique association between a message and its signature prevents illegitimate modifications and backing out from the agreement.

### Controlling Access to Resources
![[Pasted image 20230415200252.png]]
- Controlling the access to an object means protecting it against requests generated by unauthorized subjects 
- Protection is often enforced by a program called a reference monitor 
	- A reference monitor records which subject may do what, and decides whether a subject is allowed to have a specific operation carried out. 
- Reference monitor should be impenetrable by its very nature
