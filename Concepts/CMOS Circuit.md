### A CMOS circuit consists of
- A network of [[pMOS]] [[Transistor|transistors]], referred to as a pull-up network.
- A network of [[nMOS]] [[Transistor|transistors]], referred to as a pull-down network.
- The pull-up network is connected to the power supply (**VDD**).
	- Called pull-up because it pulls the output up to the VDD which has a 'high' signal
- The pull-down network is connected to ground (**GND**).
	- Called pull-down because it pulls the output down to ground which has a 'low' signal
- Both networks are connected to the output (**C**).
- Input signals feed both networks.

Operation of the system:
- If both networks are off, output is high impedance (**Z**)
- When the logic function is true, the pull-up network switches on (pull down off)
	- Because the output is connected to the power supply, the output will be high
- When the logic function is false, pull-down network switches on (pull-up off)
	- Because the output is connected to ground, the output will be pulled low
 - If both networks are on the output will be X, this is an invalid condition and is not allowed

### Implementing [[Logic Gates]] with CMOS
NAND and NOR are considered to be the basic building blocks of CMOS circuits.
#### NAND
![[Pasted image 20221231115924.png]]
Here we split the function up to the cases where it needs to turn the pull-up network on (evaluate to 1), and when it needs to turn the pull-down network on.
So we join up two circuits described above to implement certain logic

#### NOR

#### AND

Here we simply take a NAND and attach it to an inverter.

#### Motivation
- Must be controlled for:
	- Battery Life
	- Cooling
- Power dissipation has been rising steadily as circuits have been [[Moore's Law|getting smaller]]
- ![[Pasted image 20221231134357.png]]
- Energy lost reappears as heat
- Energy efficiency is the key for integration (-> performance)
- Power is now the limiting factor in high-performance [[Integrated Circuit (IC)|ICs]]
#### Solutions
- Clock gating
	- It isolates parts of a clock tree which are not in current use.  
- Glitch reduction. Switching loads is expensive. A net which switches unnecessarily (twice or more!) due to a glitch generated by logic races is a Bad Thing. It is quite difficult to design out; in detail this may be a CAD issue.  
- Latching values – especially long distance buses – so they don’t ‘flap about’ when  unused is a Good Thing. This is superior to gating them (e.g. to ‘0’) because that could introduce extra switching.  
- Dynamic voltage scaling. Slow the clock down then reduce the supply voltage. Particularly effective on V2.  
- Leakage: lower supply voltage reduces leakage. Techniques include power gating and the judicious employment of multi-threshold transistors.
