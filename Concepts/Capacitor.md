Used to store charge.

The ratio of the charge stored (Q) to the voltage across the capacitor (V) gives the capacitance (C) measured in Farads, F. In typical capacitors the capacitance tends to be very small, microFarad or less.
$$ C = \frac{Q}{V}$$

> ### $$T=R.C$$
This is relevant to [[CMOS Circuit]]s in that the time taken to switch the [[Transistor]] is dependant on the time to charge the capacitance, this is a bottleneck on the speed of the transistor.
