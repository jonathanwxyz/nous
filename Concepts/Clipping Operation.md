- Clipping takes place in the cube produced by [[3D Projections#Solution: Projection Normalisation|projection normalisation]] (easier than clipping against a frustum)  
- Clipping is easiest to visualise in 2D  
- Here is a polygon clipped against a rectangular clipping region, giving in a set or triangles
- There are efficient algorithms for clipping in 2D and 3D
