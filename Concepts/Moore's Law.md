### Definition
Moore's law is the observation that the number of [[Transistor|transistors]] in a dense [[Integrated Circuit (IC)|integrated circuit]] doubles about every two years.

### Observations
Moore’s Law has held for 50+ years  
- Geometrical (linear) shrink by every 18-24 months  
- Self-fulfilling prophecy: competing manufacturers ‘believe’ it  
- Growth forecast to slow down fairly soon  
- New generation every 3(?) years  

Eventually this must stop!  
Limits:  
- design: someone has to want/occupy the resource  
- physical: it’s made from real atoms  
- manufacturing: it’s got to be made (and work) ...  
- economics: ... for an affordable price  
- ...

### Moore's law in CMOS
As the size of transistors have shrunk in [[CMOS Circuit]]s, power dissipation issues have [[CMOS Circuit#CMOS Power Dissipation Fundamentals|increased]], however there are some ways of [[CMOS Circuit#^16cc2d|reducing]] the issue.
