1. ==Divide== the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller  
instances of the same problem.  
2. ==Conquer== the subproblems by solving them recursively. If the  
subproblem sizes are small enough solve directly.  
3. ==Combine== the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the  
original problem.

This is a ==top-down== approach - break a large problem into smaller ones  
A ==bottom-up== approach would combine smaller solutions to get a whole  
one.
