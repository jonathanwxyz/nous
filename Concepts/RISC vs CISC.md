| [[RISC]] | [[CISC]] |
|------|------|
| Reduced Instruction Set Computing | Complex Instruction Set Compuing |
| Single-clock instructions | Multi-clock instructions |
| High number of instruction per program | Low number of instructinos per program |
| Heavier memory use | Lower memory use |
| Emphasis on software | Emphasis on hardware |
| Operates on data in local registers | Can access data held in memory |
| Load/Store dedicated instructions | Load/Store incorporated in instructions |
| Fixed instruction size | Variable insturction size |

### Advantages of RISC
* Smaller die size - fewer insturctions to implement so more room for other things like cache and floating point hardware
* Shorter development time
* Higher performance - difficult to measure
* power consumption - smaller, simpler processor

### Disadvantages of RISC
* Poor code density
* They don't execute x86 instructions
