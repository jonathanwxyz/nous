## VLSI Verification
- Verification is done **_before_** silicon development. 
- It is done at time of product development for quality checking and bug fixing in design. There are different different type of verification, like IP verification, RTL verification, timing verification etc. SoC verification is used as a broader term.

## VLSI Testing (validation)
- Testing is done at **_silicon level_** to validate the quality of silicon. Bug found at validation level could be fix only by recycle of silicon which is very costly process.
