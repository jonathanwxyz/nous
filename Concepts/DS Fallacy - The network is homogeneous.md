#Distributed-Systems 

- Homogeneous networks are rare today
	- Even in a home there is probably a mix of linux and windows devices that connect to each other
- Implications:  
	- Interoperability will be needed.  
	- And so, the use of standard technologies (not proprietary protocols), such as XML (a W3C recommended general- purpose markup language) or JSON will be necessary.
