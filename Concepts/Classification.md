#Machine-Learning

### What is it?
A form of [[Supervised Learning]] which maps inputs to classes/discrete outputs
- Goal: Identify which categories a data pattern belongs to.  
- Training data: Observed data patterns and their ==category memberships==.

### Different Types of Classification
- ==Binary classification==: classify into one of the two classes.  
- ==Multi-class classification==: classify into one of the many classes.  
- ==Multi-label classification==: classify into some of the many classes
	- There is no constraint on how many classes a sample can belong to.  
	- For example document classification might label documents with many different topics
- ==Structured classification==: classify into structured classes
	- Classes can be organised in sequence, tree, lattices, graph.
