### What is an ISA?
- A function contract.
	- Basically an abstract model of a computer.
- The ISA serves as the ==interface== between software and hardware.
- It is a standardised description of how a chip works at the most basic level and provides with instructions for writing software to run on it.
- A realisation of an ISA is called an **implementation**.

### ISA Classifications
There are two main classifications / philosophies for ISAs:
- [[RISC]]
- [[CISC]]
These are compared [[RISC vs CISC|here]].
Other classifications:
- [[Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW)]]
- Long Instruction Word (LIW), similar to VLIW
- Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC)
- Minimal Instruction Set Computing (MISC)
	- Has not been commercialised
- One Instruction Set Computing (OISC)
	- Has not been commercialised
