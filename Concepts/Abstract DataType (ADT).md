### Definition
A data type defined by its behaviour (semantics) from the standpoint of a user, this is agnostic to the actual implementation of the ADT.

Example:
- List - might be implemented in many ways, including a dynamic array, linked list etc but is sure to have certain operations such as add, head, tail etc
