- If we are generating the set of solutions incrementally and searching this then we call this ==enumeration== - itâ€™s a kind of [[Brute Force|brute-force]] but hints at the fact that we were able to give some structure to the solution space.  
- Often an enumeration involves some choice which leads naturally to the solution  space having a tree structure. Problem solving can then be cast as search of this tree.  
- The leaves of the tree are normally the set of all possible solutions.
- If there are n solutions then the complexity of brute-force/enumeration is O(n)
