#Machine-Learning 

### What is it?
- **Definition**: Unsupervised learning is a type of [[Machine Learning]] algorithm that learns patterns from ==untagged data==.
- There is **no** explicit 'teacher'
- The systems form a natural “understanding” of the hidden structure from unlabelled data.
- Typical tasks include:
	- ==Clustering==: group similar data patterns together
	- ==Generative Modelling==: estimate distribution of the observed patterns
	- ==Unsupervised Representation Learning==: remove noise, capture data statistics, capture inherent data structure
