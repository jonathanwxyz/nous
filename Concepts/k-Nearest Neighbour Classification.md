#Machine-Learning 

### What is it?
An algorithm for solving [[Classification]] problems.

### k-NN Classification Rule
- Given a set of training samples {features, class-label}
- Each sample corresponds to a data point in the feature space
Algorithm:
- We take a testing point
- For each training data point we measure the distance from the testing point
- We select the k nearest points to the testing point
- Assign the testing point to the most common class within the k nearest neighbours
