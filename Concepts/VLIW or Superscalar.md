- Both issue potentially more than one instruction operation at once
	- [[Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW)|VLIW]] schedules these with the compiler
	- [[Superscalar Extensions|Superscalar]] schedules these at runtime
- Both need wide instruction fetch buses to avoid starvation
	- superscalar is more efficient, no need for padding
- Superscalar potentially faster but serious hardware is required - more area and power
