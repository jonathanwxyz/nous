#### Light-sensitive cells in the eye:  
- Rods for low-light vision, no colour  
- Cones for colour  
#### Three type of Cone:  
- S sensitive to short-wavelength visible light (roughly blue)  
- M sensitive to medium-wavelength visible light (roughly green)  
- L sensitive to long-wavelength visible light (roughly red)  

- 65% of cones are sensitive to red light  
- 33% of cones are sensitive to green light  
- 2% of cones are sensitive to blue light (but are the most sensitive)
