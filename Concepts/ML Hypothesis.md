#Machine-Learning 

### What is it?
A hypothesis refers to a prediction made by a trained machine learning model.

Usually we refer to hypotheses in the context of a model trained on a sample set:
$\text{Hypothesis A (T) : the model A trained on sample set T.}$
The hypothesis itself is still the prediction

- For example:  
	- Hypothesis 1: A 5-NN classifier trained on sample set A.  
	- Hypothesis 2: A 3-NN classifier trained on sample set B.  
	- Hypothesis 3: A 6-NN regressor trained on sample set C.

 Once we have a hypothesis, we may want to perform [[ML Hypothesis Evaluation]]
