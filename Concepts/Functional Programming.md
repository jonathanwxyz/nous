- Treat Functions like any other data
	- Define without naming
	- Functions as inputs and outputs of other functions
- Reason about them like mathematical functions
	- If f(x) = g(x) for all x, then f = g
		- We don't get these guarantees in procedural languages because perhaps the output might be different based on time of day or other pieces of data outside of the function parameters
		- This allows us to swap out functions based on performance more easily
	- let x = f(10) in x + x + x = f(10) + f(10) + f(10)
	- We want this to be true as much as possible (but might not achieve this ideal)
