#Machine-Learning 
- A complete machine learning experiment includes  
1. Model training  
2. [[Model Evaluation]]
3. Model selection: Select a best model among different options (also known as hyper-parameter selection, model selection)  
- Do not train, assess and select hyper-parameters using the same sample set.  
- You need to split the data with an appropriate strategy, utilising, e.g., [[Holdout Method]],  [[random subsampling]], [[K-fold Cross Validation]], [[Leave One Out (LOO)]], [[Bootstrap Sampling]].
