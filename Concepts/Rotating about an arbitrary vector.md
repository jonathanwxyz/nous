Step 1:
Translate the vector until it passes through the origin. This is transformation $M_1$

Step 2:
Rotate $A_1$ about the X axis until it lies in the XY plane. This is transformation $M_2$

Step 3:
Rotate $A_2$ about the Z axis until it is coincident with the X axis. This is transformation $M_3$

Step 4:
Perform the desired rotation about the X-axis by Î¸ (which we know how to do). This is transformation $M_4$

Step 5: apply $M_3^{-1}$  
Step 6: apply $M_2^{-1}$
Step 7: apply $M_1^{-1}$
