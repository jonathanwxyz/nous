#Machine-Learning 

- Many algorithms are developed to predict output based on the similarity (or distance) of the query to its nearest neighbour(s) in the training set.  
- Representative algorithm: [[k-Nearest Neighbour]]  
- Aspects to be considered:  
	- How to compute the distance?  
	- How to choose number of neighbours (k)?  
	- How to infer the output from neighbouring points?
