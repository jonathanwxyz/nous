### What is it?
A statistical measurement on a [[Confusion Matrix]] which assesses the capability of classifying positive samples.

Recall is also called sensitivity and true positive rate (TPR)

$$\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{the number of real positives}} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP}+\text{FN}}$$
